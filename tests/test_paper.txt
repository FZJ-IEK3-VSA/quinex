Abstract

Hydrogen (H2) is expected to be a key building block in future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems. This study investigates the role of liquid hydrogen (LH2) in a national, greenhouse gas-neutral energy supply system for Germany in 2045. The integrated energy system model suite ETHOS is extended by LH2 demand profiles in the sectors aviation, mobility, and chemical industry and means of LH2 transportation via inland vessel, rail, and truck.
This case study demonstrates that the type of hydrogen demand (liquid or gaseous) can strongly affect the cost-optimal design of the future energy system. When LH2 demand is introduced to the energy system, LH2 import, transportation, and production grow in importance. This decreases the need for gaseous hydrogen (GH2) pipelines and affects the location of H2 production plants. When identifying no-regret measures, it must be considered, that the largest H2 consumers are the ones with the highest readiness to use LH2.


Introduction

In order to mitigate the consequences to overshoot the 1.5 °C global warming level, states must pursue major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Germany plans to become net greenhouse gas neutral by the year 2045 [2]. Hydrogen (H2) is considered a critical component in a future German energy systems [[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]]. Both domestic production and imports are relevant H2 supply option for Germany. Its central location in Europe allows for pipeline import of gaseous hydrogen (GH2) as well as the operation of harbor terminals to import liquid or bounded H2 from overseas. These options include cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2), liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), ammonia and metal hydrides. It is still under discussion which options will be part of future energy systems. In this study, only LH2 and GH2 are investigated in accordance with the work of Stolten et al. (2021) [8] and Heuser (2021) [9]. The aim of this investigation is to analyze the role LH2 in a national hydrogen supply chain (HSC).
The use and transportation of LH2 in energy systems offers several advantages in comparison to gaseous hydrogen: Liquefying hydrogen leads to a high volumetric energy density of 2.4 MWh/m3, which is about four times higher than compressed GH2 at 300 bar and 800 times higher than gaseous hydrogen at 1 bar and 25 °C. This promises higher transportation efficiencies in comparison to gaseous hydrogen.
Furthermore, LH2 offers high purity levels of 99.97%–99.995% according to ISO-14687: 2019 [10]. Maintaining this purity throughout transportation and storage allows for applications in mobile and stationary fuel cells, and for its material use in industry. Although polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis can reach GH2 purity levels of 99.97%, the subsequent transportation (e.g., in retrofitted pipelines) and storage (e.g., in salt caverns) can make it susceptible to impurities [11].
The transportation of LH2 can be organized in a more flexible and modular way in comparison to GH2 pipelines: Germany has a well-developed transport infrastructure network (highways, railways, waterways). These existing infrastructures enable LH2 means of transportations (once developed) a faster connection to new destinations in comparison to the construction or repurposing of GH2 pipelines, as planning, construction, and approval times are lower. Experience in the design and operation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) means of transportation can support the development of LH2 transportation systems. However, new construction challenges like the need for ultra-high vacuum insulation strategy systems will arise, as the boiling point of hydrogen is 90 °C below that of methane [12].


Literature review

The literature section is divided into three parts: In the first two parts, applications (section LH2 Applications and Demand) and transportation (section LH2 Transportation) options are introduced. In the third part (section Study Comparison), relevant studies in LH2 HSC are presented. From these, the research gap and the proposed approach for this work is derived.


LH2 applications and demand

Hydrogen is a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial, transport, energy, and buildings sectors [8]. For LH2, direct and indirect potential use cases will emerge in future energy systems. The aviation sector is an example for the direct use of LH2. As weight and space must be efficiently managed in air travel [13,14], the high energy density of LH2 can make it an ideal candidate to substitute kerosene in certain cases. How suitable different options are for the decarbonization of the aviation sector depend on the traveling distance and size of the aircraft: Whereas battery–electric propulsion can be utilized for commuter and regional flights, the aviation industry anticipates long-haul flights to be powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) like bio-kerosene or synthetic power-to-liquid fuels [15]. LH2 can be best applied in short-to medium-haul aircraft of up to 150 seats [16]. The market launch of LH2 in the aviation sector is expected by 2035 [17].
Possible indirect use cases of LH2 arise when it is utilized to serve (gaseous) hydrogen demands that require high levels of purity. In future energy systems, hydrogen can serve as a fuel for process heat (e.g., in the steel, cement, glass, or paper industries) or as a feedstock in chemical processes (e.g., in Haber-Bosch, Fischer-Tropsch, and methanol synthesis processes). Especially in the case of material use in the chemical industry, high levels of hydrogen purity of over 99.99% are required [18,19].
Not only in industry, but also in the transportation sector, high levels of hydrogen purity are needed. According to ISO-14687: 2019, PEM fuel cell vehicles require hydrogen purity levels of over 99.97% with strict requirements of under 10 μmol/mol for contaminations like water, oxygen, and hydrocarbons [10]. Examples for a combined LH2-GH2 application include Linde's commercial fueling station in Sacramento (CA), USA, and in Iwatai, Amagasaki City, Japan, that incorporate LH2 delivery and LH2 on-site storage to serve GH2 (at 350 and 700 bar) demands for fuel cell vehicles [20]. These liquid systems have the advantage of requiring a smaller storage footprint in comparison to GH2 solutions, which are smaller by a factor of four [21].


LH2 transportation

The transportation of LH2 is already regulated in the European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by inland waterways (ADN) [22], rail (RID) [23], and road (ADR) [24]. Their applications in the past and present demonstrate a sufficient technology readiness level (TRL) to be considered in a case study for 2045. However, the state of technological and market maturity varies between these transportation options: LH2 trucks are already in operation today, with cargo capacities of around 50 m3 [20], whereas LH2 railcars were last operated during the NASA space program in the 1960 s [25]. Although there are still technical difficulties facing the realization of LH2 railcars today [25], the US Department of Transportation's agency PHMSA authorized the double-walled, insulated tank-railcars DOT-113A60 W and DOT-113A175 W to be used for the transportation of cryogenic hydrogen [26,27]. These railcars have a storage capacity of up to 130 m3.
NASA also uses barges for the transportation of LH2 on inland waters. Tugged LH2 barges with storage capacities of 3000 m3 first came into operation in the 1960 s and continue to be used today by NASA [28,29]. In 2020, Kawasaki launched the Suiso Frontier, the first prototype LH2 carrier for overseas transport [30]. The ship carries 1250 m3 of LH2 from Australia to Japan. Its transport capacity is magnitudes smaller than the currently largest overseas LNG ships such as the Q-Max, with up to 266 000 m3 of storage, but its size is expected to be matched in future LH2 designs [31,32].
The transport of LH2 by pipeline has been investigated, e.g., in the icefuel project, but its low transportation distance (10 km) and capacity (100–200 kW) make it unsuitable for a national transmission system [33].

Cumulative results

The key observation is a shift of the energy system towards higher LH2 imports, production, and transportation induced by higher LH2 demand. This shift increases the TAC of the entire energy system due to the changed supply situation and thus higher costs for transportation, production, and import. The share of transport costs in the energy system (TAC, including loading terminals and compressor stations) more than doubles from 0.8% in the Reference (no LH2) scenario to 2% in the Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario. Fig. 6, Fig. 7 depict the results of the scenario calculations. They present the quantity of transported LH2 by rail, truck, and inland vessel as well as the supply of hydrogen for the six scenarios. The scenarios are arranged in ascending order of LH2 demand.


LH2 transportation is only utilized when LH2 demands exist

The results of the Reference (no LH2) scenario show that there is no import, production, and transportation of LH2 when there is no LH2 demand (see Fig. 6). The higher energy density of LH2 in comparison to GH2 does not sufficiently offset the higher import and transportation costs (as shown in Fig. 5). In a scenario variation where only LH2 imports were allowed, no domestic LH2 transport takes place. Instead, the LH2 is regasified at the import location and transported via pipeline. Under the given techno-economic conditions, LH2 transportation only makes sense in cases where there are LH2 demands. Possible applications of LH2 transportation without any LH2 demands are the distribution of hydrogen on a lower regional level (“last mile” e.g., to individual filling stations or production sites) or the transmission of hydrogen in scenarios in which the construction of new GH2 pipelines or the rededication of natural gas pipelines (retrofit) is not feasible.


To cover LH2 demand, first trains, then vessels, then trucks are used

As LH2 demands increase from one scenario to another, all means of LH2 transportation are eventually utilized in the model, as shown in Fig. 6. They come into operation in ascending order of cost: First trains, then vessels, then trucks. The low LH2 demand in the Aviation scenario can be fully supplied by rail transportation. As the LH2 demand increases in the other scenarios, the limit for rail transport of 11 TWh/a (maximum send out in the two regions where the LH2 import harbors are located) equivalent to four train deliveries with 25 railcars per day on average is reached. Vessel transportation is first utilized in the Ammonia scenario (10 TWha) and is expanded in the scenarios with higher LH2 demands. In the Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario the vessel transportation reaches 166 TWha, which is equivalent to an average of 38 vessel deliveries per day making up over 90% of the transported LH2 in this scenario. The Mobility & Transport scenario is characterized by a high and decentralized LH2 demand. As the rail capacities are exhausted and not all regions can be reached through waterways, the trucks come into operation in this scenario, delivering 1 TWha. Trucks also make a small contribution to the LH2 transportation in the Chemistry and Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario of up to 4 TWh/a which corresponds to an average of 72 truck deliveries per day. As Fig. 6 shows, rail transportation serves as a base load constantly delivering 11 TWha of LH2 in the medium to high LH2 demand scenarios. Trucks operate in high LH2 demand scenarios to supply regions without waterway connections. Vessels serve as the main means of transportation as they scale up with the LH2 demand in the system.


LH2 transportation replaces pipeline transportation (to some extent)

As GH2 demands are replaced by LH2, and so is the amount of GH2 transportation. Where in the Reference (no LH2) scenario all the transported hydrogen was transmitted via pipeline, this share drops to 56% in the Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario. The transport of GH2, however, decreases less than the GH2 demands: Although 65% of the GH2 demands are replaced by LH2 in the Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario, only 44% of the transported GH2 is replaced by LH2. There are two reasons for this: First, GH2 pipelines are still used to transport hydrogen to storage facilities (large-scale salt cavern storage). Secondly, it is used to supply liquefaction plants. The results show that domestically-produced LH2 is not transported through the country, but rather produced on-site at the demand location. The necessary GH2 can be produced directly within the LH2 demand region. Alternatively, GH2 is produced in the regions with high renewable energy potentials, and subsequently transported to the LH2 demand regions. In the latter case, transportation is facilitated with pipelines.

Pipeline grids remain important even at high LH2 demand levels

As noted earlier, pipelines continue to have a high significance as LH2 demands rise: The total length of hydrogen pipelines increases from 26 700 km (including all GH2 pipelines with a diameter of over 100 mm) in the Reference (no LH2) scenario to 28 300 km in the Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario. This increase of 7% goes along with a decrease in the average capacity (diameter) of the grid of 10%. Therefore, although the transmission capacity of the network and the total amount of transported hydrogen decrease, the length of the pipeline system remains at a high (and slightly increasing) level. What diminishes in importance is the application of newly-built pipelines. The vast majority of pipelines in the system are retrofitted. Only 0.4% of the pipelines are newly-built in the Reference (no LH2) scenario. They are used to facilitate the transfer of hydrogen from the region of the GH2 interconnector at the French border. The capacity of this pipeline section is reduced as LH2 demand rises. The construction of new pipelines becomes fully obsolete in the Chemistry and Comprehensive (high LH2) scenario.
